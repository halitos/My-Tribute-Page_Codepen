        <p> Avram Noam Chomsky (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, social critic, and political activist.<br/>
       Sometimes called "the father of modern linguistics", Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science.<p/>
        <p> In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media.</br> His ideas have proven highly influential in the <strong>anti-capitalist</strong> and <strong>anti-imperialist</strong> movements, but have also drawn criticism, with some accusing Chomsky of anti-Americanism. <p>
